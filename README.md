# Polygon Editor Readme

## Overview

Welcome to the Polygon Editor project! This C# application provides a user-friendly interface for creating, manipulating, and analyzing polygons. The editor supports various operations, including moving vertices, edges, and entire polygons, adding new polygons, deleting vertices, and applying constraints such as parallel and perpendicular relationships between edges. Additionally, the editor features an advanced algorithm based on winding numbers to compute offsets for polygons.

## Features

### 1. Vertex, Edge, and Polygon Manipulation
- **Move Vertices:** Drag and drop vertices to dynamically adjust the shape of your polygons.
- **Move Edges:** Modify the position of edges to reshape polygons.
- **Move Polygons:** Adjust the position of entire polygons for convenient editing.

### 2. Polygon Operations
- **Add New Polygons:** Easily create new polygons by defining their vertices.
- **Delete Vertices:** Remove unwanted vertices to refine your polygon.
- **Split edge with a vertex:** Quicklly split an edge with a vertex.

### 3. Constraints
- **Parallel and Perpendicular Constraints:** Apply constraints to ensure edges maintain specific relationships, enhancing precision in polygon design.

### 4. Advanced Offset Algorithm
- **Offset Computation using Winding Numbers:** The editor employs a sophisticated algorithm based on winding numbers to calculate precise offsets for polygons. This feature is particularly useful for generating parallel shapes or adjusting the distance between polygons.
